Based on ArmsGlobe by Google Data Arts. We stripped out the code to its bare essentials so we only have country selection and highlighting and built the experience from there. Code not needed was commented out or left in (for debugging purposes) or deleted.

JQuerry: Currency Dial + AJAX
D3.js: Topography
